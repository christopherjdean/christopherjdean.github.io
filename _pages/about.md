I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Dalhousie University working with [Peter Selinger](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/) and [Julien Ross](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~neilr/). My research involves a wide range of areas of mathematics including higher category theory, homotopy type theory, and quantum computing.

Previously, I did my doctorate at the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Kobi Kremnitzer](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/yakov.kremnitzer) and [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/).
